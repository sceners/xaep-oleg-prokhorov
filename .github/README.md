xAEP
--------------
Removes  AEP  1.00. Doesn't depend on CPU or OS. Doesn't execute victim.
Source included.
Checked under Win'95 (4.00.950 B) and MS-DOS (6.22).

Usage:
xaep <filename>

AEP MESSAGE
--------------
AEP  is  old  and good protector especially for its age, with int 0/4/6,
DRx  tricks. It's very illustrative for the beginners in exe protecting.
But with the serious disadvantage, it uses prefetch queue tricks so it's
almost   pentium  incompatible.  That's why no breakpoints like stuff in
xAEP, just a proper remover, since there's no morphing  at  all in  AEP.
